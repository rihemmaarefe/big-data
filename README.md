Analysis using spark 

Breast cancer is causing an alarming increase in the number of deaths each year. This is the most common type of cancer and the leading cause of mortality in women all over the world. Any advancement in cancer illness prediction and detection is critical to living a healthy life.

In this project I am doing an analysis using a great tool which is spark.

What is Big Data?
Simply said, big data refers to larger, more complicated data volumes, particularly from new data sources. These data sets are so large that typical data processing technologies just cannot handle them. However, these huge amounts of data can be leveraged to solve business challenges that were previously unsolvable.

What is Apache Spark? 
Apache Spark is a data processing framework that can conduct processing jobs on very large data sets quickly, as well as distribute data processing activities across several computers, either on its own or in conjunction with other distributed computing technologies. These two characteristics are critical in the areas of big data and machine learning, which demand huge computational power to chew through large data repositories. Spark also relieves developers of some of the programming responsibilities associated with these activities by providing an easy-to-use API that abstracts away most of the grunt work of distributed computing and big data processing.

What is Data Analysis?
Although many diverse individuals, companies, and professionals approach data analysis in different ways, the majority of them may be reduced into a one-size-fits-all description. Data analysis is the process of cleansing, transforming, and analyzing raw data in order to obtain usable, relevant information that assists businesses in making educated decisions. The technique reduces the risks associated with decision-making by offering relevant insights and statistics, which are frequently displayed as charts, graphics, tables, and graphs.
